    <h2>SOHO Network Design</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and deploy a secure, efficient Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network with a focus on performance optimization and robust security protocols.</p>

    <h3>Network Hardware Configuration:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Routers and Switches:</strong> Utilized Ubiquiti routers and Layer 2/3 managed switches for optimal scalability and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>VLANs:</strong> Established to segment network traffic and enhance both performance and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Access Points (WAPs):</strong> Deployed dual-band WAPs supporting 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for flexible connectivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security Implementations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW):</strong> Implemented with deep packet inspection, application-layer filtering, and real-time threat prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</strong> Tailored to detect and mitigate specific SOHO network threats.</li>
        <li><strong>VPN Configuration:</strong> Established secure remote access using OpenVPN fortified with AES-256 encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Sinkhole:</strong> Configured pfBlockerNG on pfSense to block malicious domains and prevent phishing attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monitoring and Maintenance:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Monitoring:</strong> Conducted using Wireshark and Zennmap for vulnerability detection and network mapping.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Scheduled firmware updates and security patches to maintain network integrity and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>Successfully implemented a secure SOHO network capable of mitigating advanced threats while optimizing performance. Regular security audits and firmware updates ensured the integrity and stability of the infrastructure.</p>
