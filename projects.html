    <h2>SOHO Network Design</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> In this project, I meticulously designed and deployed a comprehensive Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network, with a dual focus on optimizing performance and enforcing robust security protocols. The project commenced with a thorough assessment of network requirements, involving detailed inventorying of all devices, precise bandwidth allocation analysis, and an in-depth evaluation of necessary security measures to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.</p>

    <h3>Network Hardware Configuration:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Routers and Switches:</strong> Utilized Ubiquiti routers and Layer 2/3 managed switches from the UniFi product line for scalability and high performance. Configured dynamic routing protocols like OSPF using pfSense to optimize path selection and ensure efficient data flow.</li>
        <li><strong>VLANs:</strong> Established to segment network traffic based on device type and function, enhancing both performance and security by isolating sensitive data streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Access Points (WAPs):</strong> Deployed dual-band UniFi WAPs supporting both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, configured with WPA3 encryption for enhanced wireless security. SSID segmentation was employed to create separate networks for guests, IoT devices, and internal systems, minimizing potential attack vectors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security Implementations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW):</strong> Implemented a pfSense-based NGFW featuring deep packet inspection (DPI), application-layer filtering, and real-time intrusion prevention capabilities. Defined granular Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage network permissions and restrict unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</strong> Integrated Snort IDS/IPS within the pfSense environment with customized rule sets to detect and mitigate a variety of network threats, including port scanning, SQL injection attempts, and brute-force login attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>VPN Configuration:</strong> Established secure site-to-site and remote access VPN tunnels using OpenVPN, fortified with AES-256 encryption to ensure data confidentiality.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Sinkhole:</strong> Configured pfBlockerNG on pfSense to act as a DNS sinkhole, intercepting and redirecting traffic from known malicious domains to a controlled environment, effectively mitigating phishing attempts and malware infections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monitoring and Maintenance:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Monitoring:</strong> Conducted using Wireshark for deep packet-level analysis and Zenmap for network scanning and vulnerability detection. These tools enabled detailed traffic inspection and network mapping to identify potential security risks and optimize network performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Implemented a structured schedule for regular firmware updates and security patches to maintain the integrity, stability, and security of the network infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>Successfully implemented a secure SOHO network capable of mitigating advanced threats while optimizing performance. Regular security audits and firmware updates ensured the integrity and stability of the infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Azure Sentinel SIEM Implementation</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> This project focused on deploying Microsoft Azure Sentinel, a scalable, cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, to enhance the organizationâ€™s cybersecurity posture through advanced threat detection and automated incident response.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection and Ingestion:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Viewer Metadata Extraction:</strong> Developed robust PowerShell automation scripts to extract critical metadata from Windows Event Viewer logs, parsing key fields such as event IDs, timestamps, user activity logs, and error codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Log Analytics Workspace Configuration:</strong> Established a centralized Log Analytics Workspace in Azure with data connectors configured for seamless integration of logs from multiple sources, including Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory, and hybrid on-premises servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security Monitoring and Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom KQL Queries:</strong> Authored advanced Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to perform in-depth analysis of log data, identifying security anomalies such as multiple failed login attempts, privilege escalation activities, and unusual network behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Workbooks and Dashboards:</strong> Designed dynamic workbooks within Azure Sentinel, incorporating real-time visual dashboards displaying key security metrics like threat detection rates, incident frequencies, response times, and system health indicators.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Incident Response Optimization:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Playbook Automation:</strong> Developed and implemented automated incident response playbooks using Azure Logic Apps, designed to execute predefined actions in response to specific security incidents, such as isolating compromised endpoints, sending real-time alerts, and initiating forensic data collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Performance Impact:</h3>
    <p>The comprehensive implementation of these measures resulted in a 25% reduction in incident response time, significantly enhancing the efficiency of threat detection and mitigation processes. This improvement translated into reduced downtime, minimized data breaches, and strengthened overall organizational security.</p>

    <h2>Active Directory Administration</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> This project entailed the comprehensive administration and optimization of Active Directory (AD) services to streamline user management workflows, enhance access control mechanisms, and reinforce organizational security frameworks.</p>

    <h3>User Account Management:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automation with PowerShell:</strong> Developed extensive PowerShell scripts to automate the entire user lifecycle management process, including account creation, group membership assignments, password policy enforcement, and deprovisioning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Group Policy Management:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GPO Configuration:</strong> Configured and enforced Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to standardize security settings across the domain, including password complexity requirements, account lockout thresholds, software installation restrictions, and desktop environment configurations.</li>
    </ul>
