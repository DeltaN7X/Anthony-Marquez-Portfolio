            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I have a diverse technical background that includes systems administration, PC support, and cybersecurity. My experience in PC support involves troubleshooting hardware and software issues, providing technical assistance to end-users, and ensuring overall system reliability. I also have hands-on knowledge of networking concepts, IT infrastructure, and security protocols, supported by my CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and CySA+ certifications.

In addition, Iâ€™ve managed complex operational systems in my role as a Water Reclamation Operator III, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and technical troubleshooting abilities in a highly regulated environment. My academic work in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University further strengthens my understanding of cybersecurity best practices, risk management, and system protection. I also hold the ITIL 4 certification, which highlights my knowledge of IT service management and process improvement. Altogether, my technical expertise allows me to effectively support, secure, and optimize IT systems across various environments.</p>
